  🚗 Car Rental System (Java Project , OOPS Concpts)
            Overview

  The Car Rental System is a Java-based console application designed to automate the process of renting and returning cars.
  It allows customers to rent cars for specific days, calculates rental costs, and lets administrators manage available vehicles and track rentals.

This project demonstrates strong understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Java such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and collections.
